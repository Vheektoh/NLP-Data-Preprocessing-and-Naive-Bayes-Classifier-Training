# NLP-Data-Preprocessing-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Training

## Overview
Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic 
manipulation of natural language, like speech and text. It is a subfield of artificial 
intelligence (AI).
It helps machines process and understand the human language so that they can automatically
perform repetitive tasks.Examples include machine translation, summarization, ticket 
classification, and spell check.Before this happens, the data has to be preprocessed 
like any other tabular machine learning training process.This research helps to shed more
light on the basic preprocessing exercise performed during text analysis.

## Processes involved
The processes involved includes: Regex, regular expression used to remove unwanted 
signs in text files,Removing stopwords, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization.
Before the final Training process is done!.
